		<h3 style="text-align:left; color:#566573">
				According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the top
				three leading causes of death in the United States in 2016 were heart disease (635,260 deaths),
				cancer (598,038 deaths), and uninentional injuries (161,374 deaths). Unintentional injuries include
				car crashes, falls, accidental poisoning, and other unintended casualties.
				<br>
				<br>
				The following links are U.S. choropleth maps that analyze the number of Americans
				killed by each cause of death in 2016 state by state. Hover over the map to see the specific
				number of deaths for each state. Each map's data is encoded based on a sequential-colored legend
				that shows the impact of the cause of death in a particular state (the darker a state is,
				the more Americans were killed by a cause of death in comparison to other states and vice versa).
